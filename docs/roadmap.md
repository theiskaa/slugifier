# Slugifier Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic development phases to transform slugifier into the fastest, most comprehensive, and developer-friendly slug generation library available in any programming language.

## Core Features

### Unicode Support & Transliteration Engine
- [ ] Language-specific character rules (German: `ü→ue`, Swedish: `ü→u`)
- [ ] Support for major scripts: Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic
- [ ] Configurable Unicode preservation mode

Currently, the library handles basic Latin Unicode characters but lacks language-specific rules and support for non-Latin scripts. This feature will add proper transliteration for German umlauts, Swedish characters, and support for Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic scripts. Language-specific rules ensure cultural accuracy - for example, German "ü" becomes "ue" while Swedish "ü" becomes "u".

### Advanced Configuration Options
- [ ] Maximum length with smart truncation
- [ ] Word boundary-aware truncation
- [ ] Stopwords removal (configurable lists)
- [ ] Duplicate separator cleanup
- [ ] Custom replacement rules

The current configuration is basic with only separator and case options. This feature adds sophisticated control over slug generation including length limits that truncate at word boundaries rather than mid-word, removal of common stopwords like "the" and "and", automatic cleanup of multiple consecutive separators, and custom character replacement rules for specific use cases.

### Performance Baseline & Benchmarking
- [ ] Benchmark suite against Python `python-slugify`
- [ ] Benchmark against Node.js `slugify`
- [ ] Memory allocation profiling
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Target: 2-5x faster than leading alternatives

Performance measurement and optimization are crucial for a competitive slug library. This feature establishes comprehensive benchmarking against popular alternatives, continuous performance monitoring, and optimization targets. The goal is to achieve 2-5x performance improvement over existing solutions while maintaining feature parity.

## Advanced Features

### SEO Enhancement Features
- [ ] Symbol-to-word replacement engine
- [ ] Currency symbols: `$5.99` → `5-dollars-99-cents`
- [ ] Email addresses: `user@domain.com` → `user-at-domain-dot-com`
- [ ] Percentages: `10%` → `10-percent`
- [ ] Common symbols: `&` → `and`, `@` → `at`

SEO-optimized slugs require converting symbols and special characters into meaningful words that search engines can understand. This feature transforms currency symbols, email addresses, percentages, and common symbols into descriptive text that improves search engine indexing and user readability.

### Language-Specific Support
- [ ] **European**: German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese
- [ ] **Slavic**: Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech
- [ ] **Nordic**: Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish
- [ ] **CJK**: Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Japanese, Korean
- [ ] **RTL Scripts**: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian
- [ ] **Other**: Turkish, Greek, Thai, Vietnamese
- [ ] Language detection from content
- [ ] Cultural context awareness (German ß, Turkish ı)

Comprehensive language support requires understanding cultural and linguistic nuances. This feature adds support for major language families with proper transliteration rules, automatic language detection from content, and cultural context awareness for special characters like German ß and Turkish ı that have specific handling requirements.

### Zero-Allocation Performance Mode
- [ ] In-place slug generation API
- [ ] Stack-allocated buffers for common cases
- [ ] SIMD optimizations for ASCII operations
- [ ] Streaming API for large inputs

For high-performance applications, memory allocation overhead can be significant. This feature provides zero-allocation APIs that use pre-allocated buffers, stack allocation for common cases, SIMD optimizations for bulk ASCII processing, and streaming capabilities for processing large text inputs without loading everything into memory.

## Ecosystem Integration

### C FFI & Language Bindings
- [ ] C-compatible API with stable ABI
- [ ] Python bindings (via ctypes/cffi)
- [ ] Node.js bindings (via N-API)
- [ ] Go bindings (via cgo)
- [ ] Rust bindings (via bindgen)
- [ ] Performance comparison documentation

Making slugifier available across programming languages requires stable C APIs and language-specific bindings. This feature provides a C-compatible interface with stable ABI, bindings for popular languages, and comprehensive documentation showing performance comparisons across different language ecosystems.

### Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] Comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documentation
- [ ] Language support matrix
- [ ] Migration guides from popular libraries
- [ ] Real-world usage examples
- [ ] API documentation with examples
- [ ] Video tutorials/demos

Developer adoption depends on excellent documentation and developer experience. This feature provides comprehensive documentation including performance benchmarks, language support matrices, migration guides from existing libraries, real-world examples, and multimedia tutorials to help developers understand and adopt the library.

### Distribution & Packaging
- [ ] Zig package manager integration
- [ ] WebAssembly builds for browser usage
- [ ] Pre-built binaries for major platforms
- [ ] Docker images for API services
- [ ] GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Package registry submissions

Easy distribution and packaging are essential for library adoption. This feature provides package manager integration, WebAssembly builds for browser environments, pre-built binaries for different platforms, Docker containers for API services, automated CI/CD pipelines, and submissions to package registries for easy installation.

## Innovation & Advanced Features

### Smart Features
- [ ] Automatic conflict resolution for unique slugs
- [ ] Context-aware slugging (URL vs filename vs database)
- [ ] Reversible slug generation
- [ ] Machine learning-based transliteration improvements

Advanced slug generation requires intelligence beyond simple text processing. This feature adds automatic conflict resolution for generating unique slugs, context-aware processing for different use cases, reversible slug generation for original text recovery, and machine learning improvements for better transliteration accuracy.

### Compile-time Features
- [ ] Compile-time slug generation
- [ ] Compile-time configuration validation
- [ ] Static slug tables for known inputs

Leveraging Zig's compile-time capabilities provides unique advantages. This feature enables compile-time slug generation for known strings, compile-time validation of configuration options to catch errors early, and static tables for frequently used slugs to improve runtime performance.

### Advanced Unicode Handling
- [ ] Unicode normalization forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)
- [ ] Script detection and appropriate handling
- [ ] Bidirectional text support
- [ ] Complex script support (Indic, Southeast Asian)

Professional Unicode handling requires support for normalization forms, script detection, and complex writing systems. This feature adds Unicode normalization for consistent character representation, automatic script detection for appropriate processing, bidirectional text support for RTL languages, and support for complex scripts like Indic and Southeast Asian writing systems.
