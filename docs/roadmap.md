# Slugifier Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic development phases to transform slugifier into the fastest, most comprehensive, and developer-friendly slug generation library available in any programming language.

## Core Features

### Unicode Support & Transliteration Engine
- [ ] Language-specific character rules (German: `ü→ue`, Swedish: `ü→u`)
- [ ] Support for major scripts: Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic
- [ ] Configurable Unicode preservation mode

### Advanced Configuration Options
- [ ] Maximum length with smart truncation
- [ ] Word boundary-aware truncation
- [ ] Stopwords removal (configurable lists)
- [ ] Duplicate separator cleanup
- [ ] Custom replacement rules

### Performance Baseline & Benchmarking
- [ ] Benchmark suite against Python `python-slugify`
- [ ] Benchmark against Node.js `slugify`
- [ ] Memory allocation profiling
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Target: 2-5x faster than leading alternatives

## Advanced Features

### SEO Enhancement Features
- [ ] Symbol-to-word replacement engine
- [ ] Currency symbols: `$5.99` → `5-dollars-99-cents`
- [ ] Email addresses: `user@domain.com` → `user-at-domain-dot-com`
- [ ] Percentages: `10%` → `10-percent`
- [ ] Common symbols: `&` → `and`, `@` → `at`

### Language-Specific Support
- [ ] **European**: German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese
- [ ] **Slavic**: Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech
- [ ] **Nordic**: Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish
- [ ] **CJK**: Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Japanese, Korean
- [ ] **RTL Scripts**: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian
- [ ] **Other**: Turkish, Greek, Thai, Vietnamese
- [ ] Language detection from content
- [ ] Cultural context awareness (German ß, Turkish ı)

### Zero-Allocation Performance Mode
- [ ] In-place slug generation API
- [ ] Stack-allocated buffers for common cases
- [ ] SIMD optimizations for ASCII operations
- [ ] Streaming API for large inputs

## Ecosystem Integration

### C FFI & Language Bindings
- [ ] C-compatible API with stable ABI
- [ ] Python bindings (via ctypes/cffi)
- [ ] Node.js bindings (via N-API)
- [ ] Go bindings (via cgo)
- [ ] Rust bindings (via bindgen)
- [ ] Performance comparison documentation

### Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] Comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documentation
- [ ] Language support matrix
- [ ] Migration guides from popular libraries
- [ ] Real-world usage examples
- [ ] API documentation with examples
- [ ] Video tutorials/demos

### Distribution & Packaging
- [ ] Zig package manager integration
- [ ] WebAssembly builds for browser usage
- [ ] Pre-built binaries for major platforms
- [ ] Docker images for API services
- [ ] GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Package registry submissions

## Innovation & Advanced Features

### Smart Features
- [ ] Automatic conflict resolution for unique slugs
- [ ] Context-aware slugging (URL vs filename vs database)
- [ ] Reversible slug generation
- [ ] Machine learning-based transliteration improvements

### Compile-time Features
- [ ] Compile-time slug generation
- [ ] Compile-time configuration validation
- [ ] Static slug tables for known inputs

### Advanced Unicode Handling
