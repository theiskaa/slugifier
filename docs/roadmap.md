# Slugifier Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic development phases to transform slugifier into the fastest, most comprehensive, and developer-friendly slug generation library available in any programming language.

## **Phase 1: Core Features** (Weeks 1-4)
*Priority: CRITICAL - Foundation for competitive library*

### 1.1 Unicode Support & Transliteration Engine

**Current Problem:**
- Unicode characters are completely stripped: `"Café"` → `"caf"`
- Non-Latin scripts disappear: `"北京"` → `""`

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Unicode-to-ASCII transliteration mapping
- [ ] Language-specific character rules (German: `ü→ue`, Swedish: `ü→u`)
- [ ] Configurable Unicode preservation mode
- [ ] Support for major scripts: Latin, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic

**API Changes:**
```zig
pub const TransliterationMode = enum {
    strip,          // Current behavior
    preserve,       // Keep Unicode as-is
    transliterate,  // Convert to ASCII
};

pub const SlugifyOptions = struct {
    // ... existing fields
    unicode_mode: TransliterationMode = .transliterate,
    language: ?[]const u8 = null, // "de", "fr", "ru", etc.
};
```

### 1.2 Advanced Configuration Options

**Current Limitation:** Only basic separator and case options

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Maximum length with smart truncation
- [ ] Word boundary-aware truncation
- [ ] Stopwords removal (configurable lists)
- [ ] Duplicate separator cleanup
- [ ] Custom replacement rules

**API Changes:**
```zig
pub const SlugifyOptions = struct {
    separator: u8 = '-',
    format: SlugifyFormat = .lowercase,
    max_length: ?usize = null,
    word_boundary: bool = false,
    stopwords: []const []const u8 = &[_][]const u8{},
    remove_duplicates: bool = true,
};
```

### 1.3 Performance Baseline & Benchmarking

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Benchmark suite against Python `python-slugify`
- [ ] Benchmark against Node.js `slugify`
- [ ] Memory allocation profiling
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Target: 2-5x faster than leading alternatives

---

## **Phase 2: Advanced Features** (Weeks 5-8)
*Priority: HIGH - Differentiation and competitive advantage*

### 2.1 SEO Enhancement Features

**What's Missing:** No symbol-to-word conversion for SEO

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Symbol-to-word replacement engine
- [ ] Currency symbols: `$5.99` → `5-dollars-99-cents`
- [ ] Email addresses: `user@domain.com` → `user-at-domain-dot-com`
- [ ] Percentages: `10%` → `10-percent`
- [ ] Common symbols: `&` → `and`, `@` → `at`

### 2.2 Language-Specific Support

**Target Languages:**
- [ ] **European**: German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese
- [ ] **Slavic**: Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech
- [ ] **Nordic**: Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish
- [ ] **CJK**: Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Japanese, Korean
- [ ] **RTL Scripts**: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian
- [ ] **Other**: Turkish, Greek, Thai, Vietnamese

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Language detection from content
- [ ] Language-specific transliteration rules
- [ ] Cultural context awareness (German ß, Turkish ı)
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for each language

### 2.3 Zero-Allocation Performance Mode

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] In-place slug generation API
- [ ] Stack-allocated buffers for common cases
- [ ] SIMD optimizations for ASCII operations
- [ ] Streaming API for large inputs

```zig
pub fn slugifyInPlace(buffer: []u8, input: []const u8, options: SlugifyOptions) ![]u8;
pub fn slugifyStream(writer: anytype, reader: anytype, options: SlugifyOptions) !void;
```

---

## **Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration** (Weeks 9-12)
*Priority: MEDIUM - Adoption and distribution*

### 3.1 C FFI & Language Bindings

**Vision:** Become the fastest slug library across all programming languages

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] C-compatible API with stable ABI
- [ ] Python bindings (via ctypes/cffi)
- [ ] Node.js bindings (via N-API)
- [ ] Go bindings (via cgo)
- [ ] Rust bindings (via bindgen)
- [ ] Performance comparison documentation

```zig
export fn slugify_c(
    input: [*:0]const u8,
    output: [*]u8,
    output_len: usize,
    separator: u8
) callconv(.C) isize;
```

### 3.2 Documentation & Developer Experience

**Current State:** Basic README, minimal documentation

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documentation
- [ ] Language support matrix
- [ ] Migration guides from popular libraries
- [ ] Real-world usage examples
- [ ] API documentation with examples
- [ ] Video tutorials/demos

### 3.3 Distribution & Packaging

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Zig package manager integration
- [ ] WebAssembly builds for browser usage
- [ ] Pre-built binaries for major platforms
- [ ] Docker images for API services
- [ ] GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Package registry submissions

---

## **Phase 4: Innovation & Advanced Features** (Weeks 13-16)
*Priority: LOW - Future-proofing and innovation*

### 4.1 Smart Features

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Automatic conflict resolution for unique slugs
- [ ] Context-aware slugging (URL vs filename vs database)
- [ ] Reversible slug generation
- [ ] Machine learning-based transliteration improvements

```zig
pub fn uniqueSlugify(input: []const u8, existing_slugs: []const []const u8) ![]u8;
pub const SlugContext = enum { url, filename, database_key, seo };
```

### 4.2 Compile-time Features

**Leverage Zig's compile-time capabilities:**
- [ ] Compile-time slug generation
- [ ] Compile-time configuration validation
- [ ] Static slug tables for known inputs

```zig
const blog_slug = comptime slugify("My Blog Post Title");
```

### 4.3 Advanced Unicode Handling

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Unicode normalization forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)
- [ ] Script detection and appropriate handling
- [ ] Bidirectional text support
- [ ] Complex script support (Indic, Southeast Asian)
